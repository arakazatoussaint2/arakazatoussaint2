# 👋 Hi, I'm Toussaint Arakaza

Applied Science & Data Student based in Canada  
Passionate about Data Science, Cloud Computing & Real-World Problem Solving  
Building practical projects using Python, SQL & Machine Learning

##  About Me

I am passionate about **data, statistics, and machine learning**, and how data can be used to **predict outcomes and support real-world decisions**.

I enjoy working on:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Predictive modeling
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Cloud-based data applications 
- Version control & collaboration with Git/GitHub

I use my GitHub as a **learning journal and portfolio**, showcasing real projects, experiments, and progress.
My goal is to become a **data-driven problem solver** who builds intelligent systems that support decision-making.
