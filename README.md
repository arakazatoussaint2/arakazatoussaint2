## Hi there 👋

I’m Toussaint — a data and applied science student based in Canada. I’m passionate about data analysis, cloud technologies, and building practical projects that turn raw, messy data into meaningful insights. I enjoy working with real-world datasets, exploring patterns, and continuously improving my skills in Python, SQL, data visualization, and cloud platforms like AWS. This GitHub is a space where I document my learning journey, experiments, and projects as I grow into a data-driven problem solver.
